**Bankist App**

This project is part of a JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann titled "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" It represents the first significant project in the course. Through this project, I developed a mini banking application that encompasses various functions, including login capabilities, account-to-account money transfers, live display of transactions per user, internationalization of dates and currency based on the user's location, and extensive DOM manipulation.
