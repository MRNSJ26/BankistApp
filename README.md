# BankistApp
This project is a part of a JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann titled "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" This is the first big project in the course, through this project I developed an mini bank application that contains many functions such as Login, Transfer money between Accounts. In general it was a fun JS project!
